# Center for Public Health Genomics Computation Group

A portal to welcome new programmers to CPHG at UVa

## Welcome

Welcome to the CPHG Computation Community! This webpage and associated repository is meant to serve as a community-curated portal to the many valuable people and resources you will work with as a member of the CPHG computational community. Please feel free to submit issues to this site and contribute to the resources listed here. Welcome to CPHG Computing!

## CPHG IT Infrastructure

* We would like to make the CPHG server structure explicit to all CPHG members, but it seems we need to put such a resource behind a firewall and require NetBadge login for security. I haven't learned the best way to do that yet.
  * [Maybe a collab site](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/a412f617-1d58-4aa2-a58a-1cd7f37b93dc/page/02d2821c-67f4-456f-ada7-023e878d92d5)
  + Key directories with useful resources available on the servers:
     - $HOME/apps : contains shared installation of commonly used tools including perl, python, R and SAS
     - $HOME/apps/statgen : contains a variety of widely used statistical genetics packages
     - $HOME/eQTL-Omics-PublicData : contains a variety of publicly available eQTL resources
     - $HOME : contains a variety of public resources
     - Note: for security reasons, I have not written the location of "$HOME" here. Please check with fellow members of CPHG to find out the location of $HOME.
